# Cloud Search Service Application Configuration #

### Summary ###
This script is designed for configuring a SharePoint Server farm with a hybrid Cloud Search Service Application

It requires the following variables:

*SearchApplicationPoolAccountName - this is the account for the search app pool. If there is an existing local SSA that same account can be reused. Note that this account must be a managed SharePoint service account.

*DatabaseServer - this is the name of an existing SharePoint database server.

*SearchServer1 - this is the name of the first new server for Hybrid Search services.  This server must already be added to the farm and should not host any SharePoint roles other than what was created when the server was added.

*SearchServer2 - this is the name of the second new server for Hybrid Search services.  The presence of this server is optional if the customer does not have a highly available SharePoint farm. This server must already be added to the farm and should not host any SharePoint roles other than what was created when the server was added.

The authors recommend that two servers be used to ensure high availability of the service application.
